 ## About
 `Bug Fix `

 The website I created is a bug/organizer website.  Where users connect and share bugs they might have while coding so they can receive help from users that they tag. 
 What it does is it connects them with the user they tagged . And once received help they have a history of all bugs they've made or helped others with.


 ## Features
 - Users can Login and/or Register. ✅
 - Users can put a brief description of the bug and tag other users for help! ✅
 - Users can leave the status as open or closed depending on the status of the bug. ✅
 - Button "resolve" can be clicked to notify others the bug issue has been resolved. ✅


 ## Usage
 - Clone the repository
 - Open using Java Program (IntelliJ .. ect)
 - Run `BugFixApplication` command to run the application
 - run on localhost:8080
